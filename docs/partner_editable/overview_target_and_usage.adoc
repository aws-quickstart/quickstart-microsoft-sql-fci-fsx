This guide provides instructions for deploying the {partner-product-name} Quick Start on the AWS Cloud. 

This Quick Start is for IT infrastructure architects, database administrators, and DevOps professionals who plan to implement or extend Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) using SQL Server on AWS with Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC). Unlike the Quick Start for https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/sql/[SQL Server with Always On Replication^], this one deploys an https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/failover-clusters/windows/always-on-failover-cluster-instances-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15[Always On Failover Cluster Instance^] (FCI). It also deploys https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/windows/[Amazon FSx for Windows File Server^] as a network share to store the database files.

This guide does not provide general configuration and usage information for WSFC and MSSQL. For general guidance and best practices, consult the Microsoft product documentation and the https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/best-practices-for-deploying-microsoft-sql-server-on-aws.pdf[Best Practices for Deploying Microsoft SQL Server on AWS^] whitepaper.
